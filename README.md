# Apple-Pay-Case
Apple is a mobile phone and computer manufacturer and Apple Pay is their mobile payment platform and digital wallet service. Competitors in the same field of mobile payments include Googled via Google Pay, Venmo and Paypal.
Apple uses their existing product ecosystem to push their new brand into an existing fintech domain by providing thrid party payment services. 
Apple had a huge existing brand prior to launching Apple Pay. This allowed them to push Apple Pay very quickly, to the point where it is a competitive disadvantage not to accept Apple Pay. However, this means that anyone who doesn't like or use Apple products will not want to or be able to use Apple Pay. Android users, for example, will not have access to Apple Pay.
Apple is going to keep growing, as their brand is extensive and the company is quick to adapt and push out new products. People trust Apple and have been quick to accept Apple Pay both in physical and online marketplaces. Apple Pay is pushing consumers to go cashless and go more for a digital service.
